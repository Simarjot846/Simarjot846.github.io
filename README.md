<h3>Our Today guest- Er.Kanwardeep kalra and Jaswinder Singh</h3>
## Insights from Our Guest Speaker at the Induction Programme

We were thrilled to have a distinguished guest speaker at our recent induction programme, who brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to share with us. Their session was incredibly valuable, covering crucial aspects of interviews, soft skills, hard skills, and even included some fascinating Science experiments

### Mastering Interviews

Our guest speaker emphasized the importance of preparation and practice when it comes to interviews. They shared insightful tips on how to present oneself confidently, answer common interview questions effectively, and highlight one's strengths and achievements. We learned the significance of researching the company, understanding its values, and aligning our answers to reflect how we can contribute to their goals.

### Soft Skills for Success

The session also covered essential soft skills that are vital in today's competitive job market. Communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability were some of the key areas discussed. The speaker shared practical exercises to enhance these skills, encouraging us to practice active listening, collaborate on projects, and approach challenges with a positive and flexible mindset.

### Building Hard Skills

In addition to soft skills, the importance of hard skills was highlighted. Our guest speaker talked about the necessity of continually updating and expanding our technical knowledge and expertise. They provided valuable resources and strategies for staying current with industry trends and acquiring new skills through online courses, workshops, and hands-on projects.

### Engaging Experiments

One of the most exciting parts of the session was the Science experiments conducted by the Jaswinder singh. These experiments were designed to illustrate the concepts discussed in a tangible and memorable way. Fo
 **Surface Tension**: We observed the phenomenon of surface tension through a simple experiment with water and a paper clip. It was fascinating to see how the paper clip floated on the water surface due to the cohesive forces between water molecules.

- **Rain Alarm**: The speaker demonstrated a rain alarm using basic electronic components. This practical experiment showed us how to create a simple circuit that can detect rain and trigger an alarm, highlighting the importance of practical knowledge in electronics.

- **Electrostatic Force vs. Gravitational Force**: An experiment comparing the strengths of electrostatic and gravitational forces was conducted. We learned how electrostatic force can be much stronger than gravitational force, even though both are fundamental forces of nature. This was illustrated by using a balloon and small pieces of paper, demonstrating the balloon's ability to lift the paper through electrostatic attraction.

- **Sound Vibrations**: To illustrate the concept of sound vibrations, we conducted an experiment with a meditation bowl. This experiment vividly demonstrated how sound waves travel through different mediums and create vibrations.

### Conclusion

The induction programme was a remarkable start to our journey, thanks to the invaluable insights provided by our guest speaker. We left the session feeling inspired and equipped with new strategies to succeed in our careers. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical exercises made the learning experience both engaging and impactful.

We look forward to applying these lessons as we continue our educational and professional development. Stay tuned for more updates and insights from Simar's blog!
